Project includes multiple class libraries can be used by multiple databases, 
with adding a connection string and definition to appsettings.json file and migration to suitable database it is possible. 
I personally used MySql because MsSql working quite slow on my pc. 

Default admin is created at start. 

Admin panel :
	-Adding and modifying procedures, 
	-Managing users (if registered user is a doctor the role can be switched),
	-Listing of bookings. (needs to be modified)

HomePage : 
	-Registration of users with auto email confirmation token,
	-Forgot password with auto email,
	-After user is logged in new booking function.
